# Gesture-Based-Rescue-Aiding-Robot
Mobile robot controlled with pre defined gestures ,which could be used for post 
disaster rescue aiding operations

Most of the commando and post disaster operations usually involve sending
trained persons to the site that is often risky and dangerous. This project gives
a safer method to execute such operations. The commando robot can be sent
to such remote areas to provide an approximate idea of the situation at the
site. This includes human detection and gas leakage detection and temperature
sensing. In most of the present day robots, user control is provided using
conventional controllers like joy sticks and push buttons. These are less user
friendly and often requires de-bounce circuits or programs in addition. The
Gesture control used here provides a user friendly solution and allows precise
control of the robot.

The objective of the project is to implement a robot that can be controlled
by human gestures wirelessly. User is able to control motions of the robot
by wearing the controller glove and performing predefined gestures. The sys-
tems for human detection, gas leakage detection and temperature sensing are
included in the robot.


During calamities rescue people cannot enter into some parts due to high tem-
perature, hazardous gases etc.It will be difficult to save people because some
people might be unconscious or severely injured.As a solution for this we have
developed a gesture controlled rescue aiding robot.
